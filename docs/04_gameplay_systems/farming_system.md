# Farming System

## Crop Cycle

The crop cycle is the time it takes for a crop to grow from a seed to a mature crop.

The cycle is divided into 6 phases:
- Seed
- Seedling
- Plant
- Mature
- Stale
- Harvested

The crop cycle is different for each crop and is affected by the following factors:
- Season
- Watering
- Fertilizing
- Rain

Some crops like trees and bushes can be harvested multiple times as they regrow.
