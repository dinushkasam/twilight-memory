### Game Concept

Inspired by games like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, and Animal Crossing. The game will be a 2D isometric game with a focus on farming and exploration. The core gameplay will be building and maintaining a farm, with the ability to explore the world and interact with the environment.

The ultimate goal of the game is to build a successful farm with many crops and animals, a beatiful home, nicely organized buildings, and a happy community.

The game should be easy to learn and play, with a focus on accessibility and replayability. All the mechanics should be intuitive and easy to understand, but also have depth and complexity, where the player can learn and improve over time.

The learning curve should be gentle, with the player being able to learn the basics quickly and then gradually learn more complex mechanics over time.

The process of learning should be fun and rewarding, with the player being able to see the progress they make and the benefits of their efforts.

The game should be a sandbox, where the player can do whatever they want, but also have a goal to achieve.

Watching the game world evolve over time should be a rewarding and satisfying experience.
