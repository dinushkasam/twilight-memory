# Core Gameplay Loop

The core gameplay loop is the daily cycle of the game. A day in the game is a specified amount of minutes in real time.

The daily cycle is divided into 4 phases:

- Morning
- Afternoon
- Evening
- Night

Players can do any activity they want during each phase, but they should be rewarded for doing activities that are better to do during a specific phase.

The daily cycle is repeated every day.

After players wake up, they can:
- Explore / forage
- Plant / harvest crops
- Build / repair / upgrade buildings
- Craft items
- Hunt / gather animals
- Fish

Sleeping at night will end the current cycle and start a new one the next day.

Sleeping is optional, but players should be rewarded for sleeping and punished if not.
